#max_iteration_number: Number of iterative optimization
#smoothness_constraint_outer_initial,smoothness_constraint_inner_initial: Constrain the smoothness (initial strength) of the external and internal deformation fields. The larger the value, the greater the constraint.
#smoothness_constraint_outer_end,smoothness_constraint_inner_end: Constrain the smoothness (attenuation cut-off strength) of the external and internal deformation fields. The larger the value, the greater the constraint.
#kernel_radius:feature extraction scope
#search_radius:search matching feature scope
#interval_save:frequency of saving result files
#interval_region_constraint:frequency of region_constraint (Reduce the frequency to get stronger constraints).
