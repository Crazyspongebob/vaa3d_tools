* Description
    -This code repository hosts source code for Vaa3D (vaa3d.org) plugin for image enhancement 
    of single-neuron images, including image intensity rescaling, bilateral filter, 
    gray-scale morphology operators (openning, dilation, tophat), and fft-based high-pass filtering.

    -Folder 'supporting_func': python code to benchmark image quality from the perspectives of 
                                           signal-background contrast, dynamic range of  background/signal, 
                                           for both within- and between-images.
    -Folder 'test_data': example image blocks from fMost image dataset of mouse brains.
